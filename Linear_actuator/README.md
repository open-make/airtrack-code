This code was made to reset the position of the linear acturator used for the Airtrack.

The main script for the Airtrack might get fail to leave the setup loop if the linear actuator is pushed. 
To solve the problem you can run the script.

For the case of testing functionality of the linear actuator or moving it to the pushed state, you can use the commented area in the void setup part.
